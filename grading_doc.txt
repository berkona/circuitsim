Go to tests/quizzes.  Click on submissions for assignment.  Go to export.  Save as xls file.

Open xls file in Excel/OpenOffice.  Click on File->Save as...->Save as csv file in a folder.
Use single quote as text delimiter b/c double quote will cause issues with proper quoting (output from circuit is proper JSON)

Open up grading_script
Ensure that the values of ID_FIELD is correct and SUBMISSION_FIELD_NAME are correct
Ensure that AUTOGRADE_PARTS is equivalent to the parts in Sakai you want graded
Run grading script with the following params:

% ./grading_script <CSV_EXPORTED_FILE> <RESPONSE_TMP_DIR> <ANSWER_DIR> > <COMMENTS_FILE>

Output is similar to lab grading script

I used a directory called HW4 and placed everything under it so my params looked like this:

% ./grading_script.py HW4/Assessment-Problem_Set_4-04242017.csv HW4/responses/ HW4/answers/ > HW4/MASTER_COMMENTS.txt

But yours may vary.

Now wasn't that easy?  Well, sorry to break it to you but now is the hard part.
Open up Sakai and navigate to tests/quizes -> click menu next to problem set -> scores -> Questions.
Open each question that needs to be auto-graded and input the correct score based on the rubric for the class.
This will probably take a while, but I haven't found a faster way to do this.

For your own benefit, the grading script outputs a list of all students for a given question whose answers were 100% correct.  It tends to help to assign 100% points to those student then go back and fill in the rest.
